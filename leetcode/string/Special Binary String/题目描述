Special binary strings are binary strings with the following two properties:

  1.The number of 0's is equal to the number of 1's.
  //串中0和1的个数相等
  2.Every prefix of the binary string has at least as many 1's as 0's.
  //二进制串中所有前缀的1的个数不少于0的个数
Given a special string S, a move consists of choosing two consecutive, non-empty, special substrings of S, and swapping them.
(Two strings are consecutive if the last character of the first string is exactly one index before the first character of the 
second string.)
 
At the end of any number of moves, what is the lexicographically largest resulting string possible?
 //要求我们任意交换两个相邻的特殊二进制串（可以交换任意次）使得最终得到的序列的字典序最大，并且满足是特殊二进制串。

Example 1:
Input: S = "11011000"
Output: "11100100"
Explanation:
The strings "10" [occuring at S[1]] and "1100" [at S[3]] are swapped.
This is the lexicographically largest string possible after some number of swaps.

Note:

S has length at most 50.
S is guaranteed to be a special binary string as defined above.
